# Team-Trident---Chassis-Design-of-Formula-Student-Racing-Car

This project is under  Team Trident, SAE Collegiate Club, IIT(BHU), Varanasi for SUPRA SAE competition. This is based on designing, simulation and manufacturing of chassis.

* **Designing** - I contributed in chassis design in SOLIDWORKS. I got to know about new features like planes, weldments, corner treatments and 3D sketches. Before designing we go through rulebook of SUPRA SAE and undertood all the constraints so that we could design according to them.

* **Simulation** - I comtributed in simulation of chassis in Ansys Mechanical using Finite Element Analsysis (FEA) to get stress-strain properties of chassis. We did front impact testing , side impact testing and rear impact testing and done hand-in calculations to verify Ansys results.

* **Manufacturing** -  After finalisation of design of chassis after getting suitable results from simulation, we proceed to its manufacturing . We used AISI 1018 steel pipes and using Manual Arc Welding to weld them .
