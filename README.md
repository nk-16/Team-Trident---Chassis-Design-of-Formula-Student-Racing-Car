# Team-Trident---Chassis-Design-of-Formula-Student-Racing-Car

<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project is under  Team Trident, SAE Collegiate Club, IIT(BHU), Varanasi, for the SUPRA SAE competition. This is based on the designing, simulation, and manufacturing of chassis.

<br>

* **Designing**  <div style="text-align: justify;">I contributed to chassis design in SOLIDWORKS. I learned about new features like planes, weldments, corner treatments, and 3D sketches. Before designing, we went through the rulebook of SUPRA SAE and understood all the constraints so we could design according to them.</div>

<br>

* **Simulation** <div style="text-align: justify;">I contributed to the chassis simulation in Ansys Mechanical using Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to get stress-strain properties of the chassis. We did front impact testing, side impact testing, and rear impact testing and did hand-in calculations to verify Ansys results.</div>

* **Manufacturing** <div style="text-align: justify;">  After finalizing the chassis' design and getting suitable results from the simulation, we proceed to its manufacturing. We used AISI 1018 steel pipes and Manual Arc Welding to weld them.</div>
